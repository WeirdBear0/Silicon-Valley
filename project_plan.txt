The features will include 4 different menu options, all put into a navbar, your profile will be on the left along with the name Delve and the menu options (Books, Chats,Settings) will be on the left.
For the searching for books, I will have a big JSON array with all the books that are in stock, and they will have multiple properties such as author, release date, genre, and pages. When a filter is selected, it will run array.includes([filter selected]) ad will only show the options that have the filter as one of their property values in the JSON.
Profile will just be an account where you can edit username, and UI color and/or theme. 
Chats will be a place where you can talk to one and/or mulltiple people who are interested in the same things/books as you.
The books will be displayed after a function call triggered by the search submit and will be displayed in a one-columns grid with one book in each row. In HTML/CSS this would be display:block.
